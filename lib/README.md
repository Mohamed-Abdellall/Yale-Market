Welcome to Yale Market! Yale Market is designed to be a cross-platform e-commerce mobile app for 
Yale students to buy and sell items such as dorm goods, clothes, textbooks, and more.

When opening the app, the first thing you will see is the home feed page. The feed page shows all 
items that other Yale students have listed. If you see an item that interests you, you can click on 
it to see more information about the item such as a description, its condition, and its price. Want 
to know more or bargain for a lower price? The “Message Seller” button at the bottom of the page 
allows you to contact the seller with any and all questions. If you'd like to buy this item, simply 
click the "Add to Cart" button.

Want to search for more items? Click over to the search page using the bottom navigation bar. Here, 
you can click on the magnifying glass on the appbar to open up the search bar. There will be 
automatic recommendations to give users some ideas of what they might be interested in purchasing. 
Once you find something you like, just click on the item to view more information.

Now, head over to your shopping cart using the bottom navigation bar. Here, all the items you’ve 
added to cart will be listed. If you wish to remove an item, you can click on the minus button on 
the right. A bar on the bottom will show a checkout button.

Now that you're done shopping, how about selling your own items for some money? Head over to your 
profile page using the bottom navigation bar. Here, you will see your profile information on top, 
including your profile image, college, and preferred payment methods. Below that is a gridview of 
items you've listed for sale. If you click on any of the images, you will be redirected to a page 
with more information about it. To list a new item for sale, click the plus sign button on the top 
right of the profile page. You will be prompted to upload a photo, and input the item's title, 
description, condition, and price.
