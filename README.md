Yale Market - Jennifer Truong, Aya Kasim, Mohamed Abdellall

Welcome to Yale Market! Yale Market is designed to be a cross-platform e-commerce mobile app for Yale students to 
buy and sell items such as dorm goods, clothes, textbooks, and more.

When opening the app, the first thing you will see is the home feed page. The feed page shows all items that other
Yale students have listed. If you see an item that interests you, you can click on it to be redirected to a page with
more information about the item such as a description, its condition, and its price. If you'd like to buy this item,
simply click the "Add to Cart" button at the bottom of the item's information page.

Want to search for more items? Click over to the search page using the bottom navigation bar. Here, you can click on
the magnifying glass on the appbar to open up the search bar. There will be automatic recommendations to give users some
ideas of what they might be interested in purchasing.

Now, head over to your shopping cart using the bottom navigation bar. Here you will see some pre-added items for
demonstration purposes. A bar on the bottom will show the total amount of your items, and a checkout button.
We initially wanted to make it so that when clicking on the checkout button, the user will be redirected to PayPal to 
facilitate the transaction between the buyer and seller. Unfortunate, implementing PayPal is currently beyond our
capabilities so the checkout button has no function.

Now that you're done shopping, how about selling your own items for some money? Head over to your profile page using
the bottom navigation bar. Here, you will see your profile information on top, including your profile image, college,
and preferred payment methods. Below that is a gridview of items you've listed for sale. If you click on any of the
images, you will be redirected to a page with more information about it. To list a new item for sale, click the "add"
button on the top right of the profile page. You will be prompted to upload a photo, and input the item's title,
description, condition, and price.
